# Py-Pass-Stealer

The  Py Pass Stealer is a program that will open up a gui window and ask people for their password to "Clean Up" their machine what it really does is email the password just inputed to whoever wants it.

How to Use:

1) Open up the python code file and see where it says ("throw away sender/receiver/password here") add your throw away sender gmail/receiver gmail/sender password to the "" on lines 5 6 and 7
2) Send it to someone and hope that they run it. You can convert it to a .exe or something so the target doesnt need python on their computer to get hacked
